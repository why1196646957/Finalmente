Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".

publi class powerUp{
int points=new int points(10)}

B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  
    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.

public class cast{
int element=spell[n]
system.out.pintln(lement);}


C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.
public void hello（）{
system.out.pintln("hahahahahaa im"+ name)}
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.
